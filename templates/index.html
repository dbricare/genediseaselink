      <h2 class="subheading">Advantages</h2>
      <p>Measuring the <b><i>strength of association between a medical condition and its genetic link</i></b> will enable pharmaceutical companies to more efficiently develop new therapies. Specifically:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>Identifying relationships between cellular pathways improves understanding of disease pathology.</li>
      <li>Providing researchers with human-validated targets eliminates the need for traditional cell culture and animal model experiments, whose results aren't guaranteed to translate to humans.</li>
      <li>Alternative laboratory-based drug discovery is very costly, time-consuming, and suffers from a low success rate.</li>
      <li>Gene-editing technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR-Cas</a> currently show strong promise as an entirely new treatment approach. If a disease-causing gene can be identified, it may be possible to develop a gene therapy to treat the genetic source directly.</li>
      </ol>
      
		<h2 class="caption">Gene-disease association and therapeutic relevance</h2>
		<p><b><u>Quick interpretation:</u></b>&nbsp; the highest priority disease candidates are found toward the bottom and right-hand side of the chart. These regions correspond to a strong association (or <b>score</b>) and low number of genes per disease.</p>

	  <h2 class="subheading" id="description">Data collection</h2>
      <p>Data is contributed primarily by academic researchers who share their results through a variety of public databases.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>A list of around 10,000 established genetic conditions is available from the <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/">NIH Genetics Home Reference</a>.</li>
      <li>A list of gene-disease associations from peer-reviewed journals and several public databases is available at <a href="http://www.disgenet.org/">DisGeNet</a>. This database is current as of August 2015. This resource compiles information from:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Curated databases: <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, <a href="http://ctdbase.org/">Comparative Toxicogenomics Database</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">ClinVar</a>.</li>
        <li>Automated databases: <a href="http://ctdbase.org/">Comparative Toxicogenomics Database</a>, <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">Mouse Genome Database</a>, <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">Rat Genome Database</a>.</li>
        <li>Literature resources: <a href="http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/">Genetic Association Database</a>, <a href="http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~bundschu/LHGDN.html">Literature-derived Human Gene-Disease Network </a>, <a href="http://ibi.imim.es/befree/">BeFree</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a> database contains human-only associations between genes and diseases organized by phenotype. It is designed not only to identify gene-disease associations but also demonstrate how these links can be put to use by the medical community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subheading">Data analysis</h2>
      <p>The metrics constructed here are based on work done for the DisGeNet database. The weighted score described below represents a metric [0,1] that describes the quality of the established link between the identified gene and associated diseases. Each gene may influence several diseases and each disease may be influenced by several genes.</p>
      <ul><b><i>Strength of association</b> = ( WUniProt + WCTDhuman + WClinVar ) + ( WRat + WMouse ) + ( WGAD + WLHGDN + WBeFree )</i></ul>
  	  <ul><b><i>Number of genes per disease</b> (fewer gene targets indicate more well-defined and easier to treat disease pathology)</i></ul>
      <p>For the <b>strength of association</b> calculation, each variable is either <i>0 or some positive value</i> based on whether that gene-disease association appears in the corresponding database. The first term in parentheses represents curated databases, the second term is predicted databases and the third term takes into account the number of publications where the link appears. The <a href="http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/dbinfo">DisGeNet About Page</a> has more detailed information.</p>

      <!--<h2 class="subheading">Data visualization</h2>
      <p>The strength of association between a particular gene and medical condition is directly related to the promise of generating a successful therapy. Large and small pharmaceutical companies who have the expertise to rapidly generate drug candidates can optimize the direction of their R&D efforts.</p><br>-->
